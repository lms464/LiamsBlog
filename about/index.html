			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			I studied computational biophysics at Rutgers Universityâ€™s Center for Computational and Integrative Biology. My dissertation investigates the boundary lipid composition of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in neuronal and Xenopus oocyte membranes, which I am wrote under the supervision of  <a href="https://branniganlab.org/">Dr. Grace Brannigan</a>. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Delaware working under <a href=" https://sites.google.com/udel.edu/phys-lymangroup/">Dr. Ed Lyman</a>.

			In my free time (pre-Covid), I loved to travel and finding deals on flights. Beyond traveling I like reading (Storm Archive currently), video games (Vermintide2), and knitting (attempting a covid genome scarf!).
