			<h1>Hi I'm Liam! </h1>
			Currently a postdoc at the University of Delaware. One of my favorite parts of grad school was training and teaching. I don't get to do a lot of that any more (especially with covid).
			My goal is to have a little science blog and upload simple documentation for intro physics and computational research.
