			<h1>Hi I'm Liam! </h1>
			Currently a postdoc at the University of Delaware. One of my favorite parts of grad school was training and teaching. I don't get to do a lot of that any more (especially with covid).
			My goal is to have a little science blog and upload simple documentation for intro physics and computational research.

			<h3> Sad new about Rutgers and an their debt</h3>
			Old by now, but I want to post about it regardless, Rutgers is $265 million in debt as a result of sports. I was a union liaison for the graduate students of Rutgers CCIB, the year we were told we would get cost of living raises. Those raises were capped durring the pandemic, not great but fine. Then physics grad students were not paid the first month of this year? Now to find out that students were not getting paid, but the school went into debt for sports, I'm disgusted, and push any incoming students to strongly weigh your options for other school. Is this a school or a company. And Rutgers, if you find this I'm totally open to talk, because it sounds like your failing at your job as a school.
