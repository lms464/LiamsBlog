# Units, Scalars and Vectors: An Over Simplified Primer

## Why units?

In science your numbers need _units_ (grams, meters, liters, seconds...). These units _combined_ with your numbers provide information on a measurement. If asked how much water is in the graduated cylander you wouldn't say 20, you need to describe 20 of what (hopefully milileters). 

For an anaolgy of the units  I think you could consider them as an adjective (though out of order): loud+music tells you a relative intensity of what you are listening to. Hot surface implies you don't want to touch the surface. 

## Physics and units

Let's take a moment and consider three of the units I mentioned earlier: grams (g), meters (m), seconds (s). I'm assuming its under stood in SI units there are pre-fixes (milli, kilo, nano to make a few) and will not go into them. But these four units encompass the first bit of intro physics. Breaking them down though:
* grams: unit for mass (not weight). Where mass describes the amount of matter within an object
* meters: unit for "length". A measurement of how far you've gone, how long something is
* seconds: unit for time. A measurment between two events, or how long something may last

Now in physics there are some caveats. The standard unit for mass in physics is kilogram (kg). And while second is standard, hours are also frequently used (1 hour = 3600 seconds). 

Second many of these usits can be combined to tell you more information. Something I knoiced when I was a tutor was when units were combined, students seemed initially overwhellmed. I'm going to provide a little table to look at a few of them:


| Unit 1      | Unit 2 |  New Unit  | definition  |
| :---------: | ----------- | -----------| -----------|
| m      | s       |m/s (speed)  | How does the distance change with time (how fast are you going)  |
| m/s   | s        |m/s^2 (acceleration)|    How does the speed change with time (how fast are you chaning speeds) |
| kg      | m/s^2       |Kg * m/s^2 = N (Force)  | What acceleration needs to be applied to move an object (or how much does an object weigh) |
| kg      | (m/s)^2       |Kg * (m/s)^2 = J (Energy)  | The capacity to do work  |
| N      | m       |N * m = J (Energy)  |  The capacity to do work |


## Scalars and Vectors

### What's the difference?
So I've text vomited about units. Without units you don't have information on what is being measured. In physics (as well as math) you can take numbers a step further scalars and vectors. 

A scalar is really what has been talked about, its a number with a unit describing a measurement. I drove 30 km and another 30 km back.

Any two _like_ scalars (they have the same units) can be summed together and should produce a larger number (so this person drove 60 km).

A vector is a number with a unit *and* a direction and you can ONLY add vectors that share an axis (x to x and y to y if you will). A number of measurements have both a scalar and a vector form, however vectors do not apply to all measurments: a mass cannot have a direction for example.

### Catagorizing Scalars and Vectors
The question I used to be asked was well what is a vector then?!?! I used to look at the students dumbfounded in part because it's a good question, in part you need slightly more math do explain. For the moment lets list the scalars that _cannot be anything burt a scalar_ from the units I've thrown at you:

* time
* mass
* energy

These are scalars no mater what, the do not need to have a direction associated with them. What's that leave us with? Units for speed, acceleration, length, force. Well which is a scalar and which is a vector?

### Vectors

Let's look at a vector. In 2D (drawing on a map for example) a vector has a *x* (left/right) and a *y* (up/down) direction.

Lets start with a simple example using the map of NJ. We will define one axis that goes where north east is positive and south west is negative.

 You travel from Haddon Heights to Carney's Point. It's about 30 km south west (3000m), and back another 30 km north east.

The "vectorized" version of distance is called displacement. 

NOW, remember, a vector has both a value and a direction. Here south and west will be considered going in a negative direction, while north and east are a postive direction.

You travel 30 km south west (where south west is the direction). On your way back you travel 30 km north east. Adding the two displacements together will sum to 0 km. What? How?! 

Remember how we defined the directions. 30 km south west is negative, while 30 km north east is positive! 

Now in intro physics you'll tend to work with x, y, and z instead of north, south, east and west.

## Scalar and Vecctor Overlap

At this point you may be asking, and rightly so, why do some scalars and some vectors overlap? And the answer is any vector can be written as a scalar if you take the *magnituded* of the vector. For the moment don't worry about how we do that, note that anything written between two |   | is the magnitude. Four examples are below.


|  Unit   |      Scalar      |    Vector    |
| :-----: | :--------------: | :----------: |
|    m    |     Distance     | Displacement |
|   m/s   |      Speed       |   Velocity   |
| m/(s^2) | \|Acceleration\| | Acceleration |
|    N    |    \|Force\|     |    Force     |

#### Drawing Vectors



Lets start with drawing a vector one peice at a time on a x-y plane. Vectors will be described as colored arrow on either an x or y axis. We start with a displacement in y, where some one has walked 3m in the positive y direction.

![Displacement Figure](_images/Displacement/Displacement.004.PNG)



Now from the point left off, we walk 4m's in the positive x direction

Lets now draw the two vectors together. Doing this we see a clear picture of how we've travled, and in what direction! This example can be extended to be used for ANY vector, forces, velocities...

NOW, if we want to calculate a distance (the scalar) of the vectors show directly above:

![Displacement Figure](/_images/Displacement/Displacement.006.PNG)

The distance is the squareroot of sum of both vectors squared. 



Now remember this, any scalar cannot be plotted like a vector. I cannot plot energy's direction. I _can_ plot energy per time, or energy per distance. I cannot plot energy in the x direction.
